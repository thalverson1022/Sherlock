Sherlock v2.0
Created By: Thomas Halverson
 
This code uses a modified A* algorithm to find all of the phase space points below an energy 
cutoff for a given Hamiltonian.

Ecut <= H(x1,p1,...,xn,pn) 

It creates the input files for the Switchblade diagonlaiztion code. 



Compile Instructions:
   A compile script is provided (compile.sh). There are only two source code files, one for 
   the main code and the other for the modules. THe code can easily be compile without the 
   script since no compiler flags should be needed.

Running Instructions:
   The only input file to be specified at runtime is .in file, which contains the file 
   location and names of the each of the needed input files. Once this file is created
   for a given system, it will not need to be modified.

   Test Case:
     This code conatins a simple test case for a coupled, three dimensional anharmoic
     oscillator. To run is test case, simply use the input file <test.in>. The parameters 
     can be changed in the -UI file <3Dtest-UI.dat> (see below for more details). 
   
     If compiled using the compile script, the test case can be run simply with

       ./sherlock ./test.in
    

User Inputs:
   The file designated with the -UI tag is the user input file. This file copntains the 
   adjustable paramters. Once all of the inputs for a specifc system are created,the user 
   should only interact with this file. 
   
   The file contains three user inputs (as indicated in the test example).

      1. Energy Cutoff is the value that defines the outer edge of the Hamiltonian contour.
         In other words, the is the truncation parameter and should be adjusted to define a 
         specific basis size for the given problem. 

      2. The mtype flag defines whether the the x-grid is defined at whole integer values 
         or half integer spacing. Seperate system files need to be created for each typoe of 
         grid, so we must be careful when switching this flag. Files for whole integer have
         the desigation -WI and those for half integer are designated with -HI. The test 
         system is only set up for -HI, so for that example this flag should remain 1.

      3. The filename is simple the name and location of the output.


System Files:

    Each new physical system requires a series of system files, created with the proper grid
    type in mind. There are four directories, each of which contains a system file for a given 
    system. All system files MUST be specified or the code will crash. 

    ./Masses

       This file contains a list of 'n' numbers (n=number of modes), which corresponds to 
       1/(2*<particle mass>). The numbers must be in the same order as the harmonic frequencies 
       see below).

       Example:
         For the test case, the mass file <3Dtest-masses.dat> contains the number 1.0d0 three 
         times, corresponding to three modes. Since the test case is a normal mode Hamiltonian, 
         the masses are the same value as the harmonic frequencies.   


    ./Maxes
       
      This file contains the hard limits on the coordinates. In cases where the PES is only 
      valid in a certain range, these values can be used to limited the search distance, either 
      by a harmonic radius or since coordinate limits. 

      Example:
        The test case is a single well anharmonic potential, therefore the hard limits are set to 
        be those of the single dimensional hard limits: +/-20. The radius is set to also be this 
        limit: +20   

    
    ./PEs

      THis code usitlizes 4th order Taylor series expanded normal mode coordinates. The PES 
      file contains the coefficents of those expansions.

      Example:
        The test case PES, <3DTest_PE.dat>, has the following format:

        <number of modes>  <number of coefficients>
        <x1 power> <x2 power> <x3 power>    <coefficient>


    ./Starts 

      These files contain the starting point, in phase space, where the search begins. 

      Example:
        The test case is a deep well centered at the origin, so we use the origin as the starting point. 
        However, since we are on a half integer grid in x, the starting point is 
         (.5,.5,.5.,5,.5,.5)
